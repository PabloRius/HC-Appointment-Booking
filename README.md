This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

- Local Deployment Limitation: This application will not work by simply cloning and running it locally unless you set up a MongoDB replica set, which is a Prisma requirement. Without this, Prisma operations will fail.

- Live Demo Available: To avoid the complexity of setting up the environment locally, you can fully test and use the application on the live deployed version hosted on Vercel:

      üëâ Live demo: https://hc-appointment-booking.vercel.app/

- Dependencies: If you choose to set it up locally anyway, don‚Äôt forget to install the dependencies first:

```bash
npm run install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

## üöÄ Getting Started (for development)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or

# or

```
